  <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-light-blue w3-padding-32">Part 3</p>

    <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>9)  God has promised unlimited power to those who qualify and ready themselves in these last days at this time.</i></p>
  
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
    
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Every one of us. And every one of us can qualify. Before a race they have these time trials. That’s what we’re in right now. We’re either going to make it or we’re going to be rejected, one of the two. I mean it, and so does God. We’re in the time trials now. You have to come up with certain qualifications to go on in, to run the race. Paul says, I run the race – what? -- to win. And God is a just God and a gentle God, but still a God of wrath. As long as you have that desire in your heart to make it and to go on and be willing to do what he asks us to do, he’s not going to forsake us.
        God has promised unlimited power to those who qualify and ready themselves in these last days. Now, here are some of the things he spoke to me. He’s offering us creative power, unlimited discernment, unlimited knowledge, unlimited healing power, to be translated, transported, transcending into the very power and presence of God Almighty himself. Now did you ever hear of such promises to human beings in your life? Not laying in jail in a hole somewhere, but to be transformed and transcended into the very power and presence of God himself: into the fulness of the glory of God. For obedience, that’s all; just for obedience.
        It looks like God is just saying, “Look at the two comparisons. Look what I’m offering you. This or that: which one do you choose?” We would rather have our little petty feelings to pamper and to do our own thing. I take it serious when God speaks to me something like this; it’s just as serious as what I read out of this Book. And every word that’s been spoken today you can find in this Book, if you know the Word of God.
        All limitations of the flesh gone. This is the Word. This is the Word. God. Christ himself. This word: all limitations of the flesh gone, and God himself takes over the flesh by his Spirit. This flesh will have all the limitations taken off of it. Now what do we see? We can see this far, that’s true; half discernable. But when the Spirit takes over, there will be complete discernment in all things, in all of the handiwork of God: in every thing. We’ll see every need of everybody. We’ll know where to go, what to do, because the Spirit of God will move upon us, and we will obey the Spirit. But we have to first put this body under subjection, this flesh. Complete authority over all sickness, disease, death, kingdoms, Satan, governments, cities, wickedness, and power over all flesh. And when he said that, I knew I was hearing from God, because the Lord, Jesus Christ, said that he had power over all flesh. And that is our inheritance. That was his inheritance. This is why he suffered on the cross, that he might obtain that, for the joy that was set before him, knowing that he was going to get filled with all the fulness of God.</p>   
  

        <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>10) He said, "This will cost you something, to receive this."</i></p>
  
        <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
          
          
          
          <p class="w3-justify">This is what he’s offering. But he said this will cost you something. Every flesh desire must be under the sanction and authority of the Spirit. We’re stuck with these flesh bodies for a while here, you see. We’re going to be tried, just like Jesus was tempted 40 days in the wilderness. He was flesh. All he had was the heavens had been opened unto him where he had an understanding and a relationship with the Father. Then after he was baptized, he was immediately led into the wilderness to be tempted. And we are still going to be tempted. Now we must make that clear. But he says every flesh desire must be under the sanction and authority of the Spirit. Every thing we do! We must not do it unless we know that it is sanctioned by the Spirit.</p>   
    

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>11)  Just reading and learning God by the mind will not 
            accomplish this.</i></p>
  
          <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="w3-justify">By our carnal mind. It will not accomplish it. We must experience it by the Spirit. You see, the word alone is death, but the Spirit maketh alive. We must seek God. You say, “Well how am I going to do it?” Seek him. Ask him. Wait before him until we are empowered with that power of the Holy Ghost. God knows we’re but flesh. We cannot do it by ourselves: it has to be by the Spirit. But he will not do it while we sit and twiddle our thumbs. We must sincerely seek God and trust him and believe his Word when he says it.</p>   
   

            <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>12)  This can only be achieved by a knowledge and a
              relationship with Jesus Christ.</i></p>
  
            <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
              
              
              
              <p class="w3-justify">He has the keys to the kingdom. He has the keys to the kingdom. It’s through him, that all powerful one, that we can come in. By faith, and a knowledge of God’s word, and faith to believe it. This can only be achieved by a knowledge and relationship with Christ - by faith - and a knowledge of God’s word, and faith to believe it! The word of God. This is why God has been teaching us lately. How we would pray for someone instead of getting all shook up. He’s teaching us how to believe the Word of God. And we see results when we say, “Now your Word says it, Lord. Now we’re just going to ask this of you.” And watch it be fulfilled. And the prayers are being answered. Because we’re believing it. Because God’s Word says it, it has to come to pass. And if we follow the pattern, to ask the Father in the name of the Son, it has to come to pass. It has to come to pass.
                It can only be achieved by a knowledge and a relationship with Christ. Not just a knowledge, but a relationship with him: a personal, personal relationship. And how do we build upon that relationship? Through the Word, through the Spirit, through fasting, through prayer, and especially through making love to him. Tell him how much you love him. He loves to be praised. He loves to be praised. And he loves to be recognized for who he is. He loves to be thanked when he does something for us. He loves to hear us say it: Thank you, Lord.</p>
