  <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i><i class="material-icons" style="font-size:48px; color:red;" onClick="togglePlay()">call</i>1)  Most flesh manifestations in the meeting are under control.</i></p>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
    
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">There’s a growing in the Spirit. I can see the growth in the Spirit, because we are being settled and 
        compacted and becoming strong. And the things that you once could not overcome, I see God overcoming: because we find out 
        we do not go by feelings, but we go by faith in the Son of God - and by the Spirit. It is not by our fleshly manifestations: 
        that profiteth nothing. But it is by the Spirit that we grow. The church world has taught us that the more you jump, the higher 
        you jump, the louder you squeal, and the more you yell, the more righteous you are. That’s a lot of hogwash. That is absolutely 
        against the Word of God. That has nothing to do with it. I have watched some preachers that were out sleeping in bed with some 
        woman (and their wives back home), sleeping in a bed in a motel somewhere, go out and preach and jump and holler and yell, and 
        I know what their lives are. I thought, “God that’s not you,” even though some of it was truth that they were preaching. And 
        the people received because it was the word of God. 
        This Order that God is bringing in now -- is for keeps. This is the end times, the building of a new order, of perfecting of 
        the order that he had. This is coming in for keeps. This is the final windup of bringing man back to his place and reinstating him 
        in the order that he intended him to be in in the beginning, when he will rule and reign over all the works of the hands of God. Amen. 
        The Lord had called a halt and a quietness to come in our group to where everybody was even afraid to say anything, almost. We’re 
        loosening up a little bit now. But I thank God for that because I know it was the Spirit of God that wanted to call a halt to all 
        of this - that he can build now on a new order. But first….</p>   
  

        <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>2)  We must have a breakthrough into the real overpowering power of the unlimited resources of God.</i></p>
  
        <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
          
          
          
          <p class="w3-justify">I know he wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t possible to achieve: to have a breakthrough into the real overpowering of power: this is a power that overcomes everything, everything, completely: the power of God to overcome everything, not only out here in the world, but a breakthrough in us - in our spirit: that we would have power to overcome everything in our lives. We’ve got to have that kind of a breakthrough to where the flesh has no hindrance over us whatsoever. And he told me how we’re going to receive this, in a measure. The time must come when we’ll break through in faith to God: to where we can receive this power. 
              Now we’ve had little sprinklings, and we’ve had showers, and we’ve been changed and we’ve been lifted up in heavenly places with the Lord. We’ve had dreams; we’ve had visions; we’ve been carried out in the Spirit, and we’ve prophesied, and we’ve done all of these things, and thank God for it. We’ve had power to cast out Satan. Thank God for all of that, but that’s still in a lower realm. He said we must break through into the real overpowering power of the unlimited – unlimited – resources of God. 
              That blows your mind doesn’t it, that we can come into that place: where the unlimited resources of God are now. He’s still creating: God is still creating in the heavenlies. He didn’t stop creating. We are still discovering things that are new. We know that he is recreating bodies (restoring us in health). Otherwise, I would be dead!
              What’s going to happen when we break through into the unlimited power of God? We know that it’s coming; that’s the promise of God. We are heirs and joint heirs with Christ, and he has stepped into that unlimited power. He said, “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.” Well, if we’re heirs and joint heirs with him, then we are to receive that same power.</p>   

              <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>3)  We must now learn to build back the manifestation of the Spirit in truth according to the Spirit.</i></p>
  
              <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
                
                
                
                <p class="w3-justify">Remember what he said, He’s going to build this people to go in and possess the land, so we can’t be like other people. Now I’m sure there are other groups like us, but he has put us together for a purpose. So he says we must now learn to build back the manifestation of the Spirit in truth according to the Spirit! That’s going to take some doing, isn’t it? Of course, once we come to that breakthrough - that unlimited breakthrough - we won’t have to worry about that because we’ll just automatically do the will of God. All of the flesh desires and things will be gone, and we’ll just move by the Spirit.
                    We can’t move in the old order any more. We’ve come to that time, would you believe it? I’ve waited a long time for this (not knowing), and here he’s giving me instruction. I’d go home and I’d bawl, because all of us that enjoy the freedom of this, tongues and everything, which is so beautiful and it would lift us up in the Spirit, then God started laying the hammer down. I’d say, “Lord, they’ll all leave.” And he’d say, “Leave that to me; that’s my problem.” That’s God’s problem, see. Now tongues are still good. I’m not discounting them, but we have to know what they’re for, and how to operate them under the anointing of the Spirit, not use them in the flesh to try to bring the anointing. But when the anointing comes upon us, then we’re free because it will be right: after the order of the Spirit.
                    But the thing – now - that God is going to start doing is teach us the order of the Spirit. Won’t it be a glorious day when we really come in to that perfect order of the Spirit, where he can just manifest himself? Oh, once in a while it might be kind of noisy when there has to be some ministering in the Spirit, but I believe mainly it’ll be so sweet and so beautiful, so Christ-like! In such power and glory that you won’t hardly have to say a word. It will just be --- by the Spirit. Maybe the Spirit will just give someone a direction in the Spirit and we’ll know by the Spirit what he wants, because it won’t be us that is speaking: it will be him. We’ll know just by the Spirit as he leads us. We’re going to come into one of the most beautiful manifestations of the Spirit of God, in that purity and cleanness and beauty and love - that no man has ever attained to -- if they’ll follow, if they’ll follow this. As I said before, this is the final windup of all of this now. He’s starting to train a people how to possess the land.
                    We have never tasted joy, we have never tasted peace or revelation, yet, like he’s going to have it. He’s preparing us now, so we won’t go wild, but we will quietly wait until we know what the manifestation of the Spirit is, and we won’t take it and run with it; but we’ll be prepared to know exactly what he wants with us: Because God is a God of order and beauty.</p>      
   

                    <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>4)  Each one of us must individually seek God until we know what God’s will is for us, and what our ministries are.</i></p>
  
                    <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
                      
                      
                      
                      <p class="w3-justify">Everybody has a ministry here in this room; everybody has some type of ministry. Every one. How many actually know for sure - exactly - what your ministry is? That’s the way it goes; that doesn’t surprise me. We haven’t been taught. Don’t be embarrassed about it. God will reveal it in his time. You see, if he’d reveal our complete ministries ahead of time, we’d run off and try to do it and mess it all up. We’d just mess everything all up after the flesh. We’d get the flesh in there and try to fulfil it. So we must seek God until we hear from him ourselves, individually. If you want to know something, don’t ask your neighbor, ask God. He’s well able; he’s well able to talk to you. He likes to talk to you. He’s just waiting to get the chance. We’re so busy and so full of ideas, and running everywhere else to find out “answers from God,” that he just shuts his mouth and sits there and lets you run. It’s the truth! That’s the truth. We’ve never really given him a chance to answer us. Somehow we think that God will speak to Joyce or Marilyn or Don or any one of us quicker than he’ll speak to you. Now that’s ridiculous. 
                          If you’re walking before God with all your heart - and you have a need - don’t you suppose your heavenly Father wants to reveal it to you? Now I’m not eliminating the Body of Christ (because we do minister one to the other), but I believe that when you really have something that you need to hear from God for -- he’s going to answer you. But you know what happens? We get all upset, and we want “answers,” and we run off at the mouth. Everybody knows our problems. Everybody’s got an answer. And God does not have a chance to say a word. Isn’t that the truth? I’ve done it. I think we’re all flesh. Every one of us came out of Adam, with Adam’s nature - every one of us! I’m not saying that you’re not supposed to talk to one another about your problems, but if you want an answer: go to God. The sweetest thing you’ll ever hear is when you know that God spoke and you can say, “I know it’s the truth! God spoke it.” 
                          When we get answers from someone else beside God, it usually brings confusion to our minds. He’s smart: he knows the answers. Running usually brings confusion. But when the anointing comes on somebody and God moves by his Spirit, then you can take that as from God, because it’s God speaking. But unless somebody’s in the Spirit (and I know the Spirit) and the anointing of God is on them, I don’t want their answers. I don’t want to hear it. That’s why I don’t go to people. I have problems just like everybody else. Because: human minds bring confusion to your mind when you come to them with questions (or needing answers) unless that one is under the anointing of God. It just naturally brings confusion.</p>
