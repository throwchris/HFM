  <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-light-blue w3-padding-32">Part 2</p>

    <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>5)  When we get answers from anyone but God, or through others, it usually brings confusion unless it is given under the heavy anointing of the Spirit when only truth is spoken.</i></p>
  
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
    
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Where, or when only truth is spoken – under that heavy anointing! And you’ll know it in your heart: when it’s true; you’ll know that it’s God. You’ll know by the tone. You’ll know by the Spirit. You’ll know it, when it’s under the heavy anointing of the Lord. You can’t mistake it. You can take it as truth from God. But when it’s after the flesh…. We get ourselves into more difficulty and more trouble by trying to receive answers after the flesh from one to the other: it’s the truth! It really is the truth!
        Nearly every one of us is guilty of this at one time or another. We’re looking for help - and we don’t know where to go. We’re so confused in ourselves that we go and seek fellowship one with the other: first thing you know, the thing that’s on our heart is out. You see, out of the heart the mouth speaketh. 
        So what’s in our heart comes out of our mouth. You can camouflage it for a little while, but if you talk for a little while with somebody, you’ll find out what’s on the heart. But when we go through a problem, look to God in your secret closet, and say, “God, you reveal it to somebody. Let them know what I’m suffering. Let them know what I’m going through. Give them the answer, Lord. If you don’t want to speak to me directly, then give somebody else the answer.” And if it’s never been out or been circulated, then you’ll know it’s from God when it’s spoken. This is some of the new order that he’s trying to bring us into. We’re going to be a brand new people when he’s through. God is doing this because he loves us so.
        Now there is a manifestation of the flesh and there is a manifestation of the Spirit. How are you going to keep that where it’s the two? How are you going to know when it’s Spirit and when it’s flesh? I mean as individuals, ourselves. This flesh is such a deceiver. I’ve said myself, “I just KNEW that was God that wanted me to do that,” but it didn’t work out. “I just KNOW that was the will of God, what happened?” It wasn’t God.</p>   
  

        <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>6)  There is a manifestation of the flesh and there is a manifestation of the Spirit. The flesh must be under control of the Spirit at all times, especially where we’re dealing with others.</i></p>
  
        <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
          
          
          
          <p class="w3-justify">We must know that the Spirit is in control, or keep our mouths shut! You see, we love people, we try to help one another and that’s good, but it’s not good if we give them a flesh answer. I repeat: it is not good if we give a flesh answer. Now, if we can learn to control the flesh by the Spirit; if we can seek God and cry out to God until we can break through in a measure into this unlimited power of God, we’re not going to have this problem any more. He told me the Spirit without the flesh is nearly useless. Isn’t that a strange thing for the Lord to say? He’s all powerful! </p>   
    

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>7)  But the Spirit of God without the flesh is almost useless, as God has chosen mankind to overcome and minister. This was his plan.</i></p>
  
          <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="w3-justify">Now the flesh is no good without the Spirit; absolutely no good without the Spirit, as far as God is concerned, for any use to him. But the Spirit is almost useless without the flesh, because we have to hear the Spirit. If somebody’s speaking, we have to recognize it: we have to discern what we hear - by the Spirit. We have to have a voice to speak out what God says to us. We have to walk when he sends us, or drive or whatever. So he has chosen to put his Spirit within earthly vessels to deliver the Spirit where he wants it. But this shocked me when he said, “The Spirit without the flesh is nearly useless.” Although the Spirit fills the earth. But if you’re not aware of it… He said, “Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word.” You’ve got to have ears to hear. You have to hear with this ear first before you can hear with your spiritual ear, right? So you see, he didn’t only save the soul, but he saved the body, soul and spirit - all three. Makes us complete. He hasn’t quite got this flesh under control yet, but it’s coming. But still, in order to hear, you have to have flesh ears. What good would it do if the Spirit was out there, if you never heard about the Word, if you didn’t have ears to hear? It’s according to the Scripture. Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word! This Word! You have to have eyes to see to read the Word (unless you know Braille). But I’m talking about a normal human being.
                Now I know the Lord can speak audibly (because he’s spoken audibly to me several times, and I thank God for it, and I’m not saying it boastfully), but he has chosen man from when he first created Adam, to rule and to reign over all of the works of his hands. He gave him the earth and told him to dress it and keep it. But he disobeyed. Now he’s bringing back a people again that’s going to rule and reign over the earth and dress it and keep it. This is what it’s all about. This is in his plan. Also, the flesh without the Spirit is almost useless. God has chosen to use the Spirit through these worthless earthen vessels.</p>   
   

                <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>8)  The flesh vessels must be emptied out and cleaned before the Spirit will manifest himself through us in this new order 
                  about to be revealed.</i></p>
            
            <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
              
              
              
              <p class="w3-justify">Remember, you can’t put new wine in old bottles, so there’s got to be a change somewhere, in us. I don’t know how the Spirit’s going to do it, but I know that he said that the old vessels must be emptied out completely, and cleaned - cleaned, cleansed, completely pure - before the Spirit will manifest through us in this new order about to be revealed. God has great things for us! That makes me real excited. And I just get a real settled peace in my heart, knowing that God said it and he’s going to do it. I don’t know one thing to do: only to obey what he told me to do. Tomorrow I don’t know. I don’t care. But today, right now, this minute, just be willing to let him empty you out - all self is gone: everything, all your will, whatever it is, and then let him wash you. Because we can’t wash ourselves. We can’t cleanse ourselves. We can go as far as we know to go, by laying down the things that he’s laid his hand upon in our lives. But we don’t know really how to cleanse ourselves, and he does. We must empty out this vessel and clean it -- before the Spirit will manifest through us in this new order about to be revealed. So what is this new order? We know what the new order is: ruling and reigning with Christ on the earth, and the kingdom of God: Christ our head, and us ruling and reigning as a body, as one body --as the body of Christ -- ruling and reigning on the earth!</p>
