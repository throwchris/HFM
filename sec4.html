  <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-light-blue w3-padding-32">Part 4</p>

    <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>13)  Practice prayer, believing for the answer.</i></p>
  
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
    
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Practice prayer, and believe him for the answer.</p>   
  

        <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>14)  God’s promises are true and he will not fail.</i></p>
  
        <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
          
          
          
          <p class="w3-justify">If we come to him in faith! You know what he said about the mustard seed and the mountain. Now we haven’t gotten that far yet, at least I haven’t seen anybody move any mountains lately, have you? But his Word, if we can come into that relationship, that closeness. But we try to put the cart before the horse. We try to do these things before we have received that relationship with Christ. And every once in a while, he takes pity on us and lets us do some big miracle; we crow. Ain’t it the truth? It’s just because he loves us, and he wants to draw us a little closer to himself. We haven’t touched the thoughts of the Father yet.
            When we start to draw close to God, you see how little you really are. You realize that God is God. Now we don’t know yet for sure; we know him in a little portion. And these boasting preachers…. Sure we’ve had some tremendous experiences in God, and I thank God for every one of them. I thank God. But to know him in his fulness, it blows our minds when you think about it. But he will not fail; he’s promised us.</p>   
    

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>15)  If your prayers are not being answered, check your motives.</i></p>
  
          <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="w3-justify">And I’ll check mine. Why do we want what we’re asking for? You know what it says in the Book of James about asking amiss, that we want to consume it upon our own lusts, our own flesh desires, if our prayers aren’t answered. Or because it’s some special thing in our own self that we want fulfilled. Check your motives. If your prayers are not being answered now, go before God with this. And check your faith, if you’ve asked in faith or did you just blab it out? Wait until God gives you faith. Check your faith, and God’s timing, if your prayers aren’t answered. Sometimes God lets you know something, but it isn’t quite planned; he lets you know ahead of time. So we get all flustered and say God isn’t answering our prayers. Well, we know he’s heard, and we know the answer’s on the way. So if we’ve asked in faith, it should come. And check your commitment to him concerning our flesh desires and our spirit. Check his Spirit and our spirit. Find out if it’s God that wants you to pray this way. I’m pretty careful about what I ask for. I believe before we talk to God, we ought to check our motives to find out why we want it; is it for God’s glory or for our glory? Check our spirit and see if that’s what God wants us to have. Check our motives. And above all, check and see if our spirit’s right so we have a right to go to him.</p>   
   

            <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>16)  And how much time do we give to him?</i></p>
  
            <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
              
              
              
              <p class="w3-justify">How much time do we actually give to God, or how much time do we give to the flesh? He said, “In prayer”; how much time do we give to him in prayer? Now I’m not talking about prayer -- asking him for things. I’m talking about dedication: meeting with him, staying in his presence, letting him draw close to you --- establishing that kind of a relationship with Christ. That kind of prayer, not prayer asking for things. Praise unto him. In your closet, by yourself, wherever you are - when you’re alone. Build on that relationship with love and quietness before him. And in service: how much do we do for God when he sends us? Don’t go unless you are sent. How much time do we give him to make love to him? And in quietness, in fasting? How much time do we spend alone speaking in our prayer language to him? This is where our Spirit is strengthened. He didn’t just give you that so you can say, “I’ve got the Holy Ghost.” He wants us to use it. That’s a prayer language. When the natural mind doesn’t have an understanding of what your need is, when the Spirit prayeth, it edifies and strengthens our inner man. So we must use that prayer language. Now don’t lose the vision of what he’s told us from the beginning here: that he’s building a new order in his last days. And first thing you know, if we follow on, we’ll be spending almost all of our time in prayer, in fasting; in being so happy you’ll be turned inside out. Because if you spend a lot of time with him, you can’t help but get happy, because that’s the way it works. He dumps out more than you put in. That’s the way it works every time. And these are some of the secrets that he’ll use - and that he is using - to bring a people into that place of rulership.</p>

    
              <p class="w3-text-blue w3-xxlarge"><i>17)  Expect great things from God after we’ve learned obedience for a while and after we’ve learned to put this flesh under subjection.</i></p>
  
              <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
                
                
                
                <p class="w3-justify">He said, “Expect great things from me, if you are obedient in all your commitments.” Then we can just ask -- and he’ll do it. He deals with us just like a father does with his children. If that son is always obedient, “Hey Dad, can I have an ice cream?” “Well, sure!” He can hardly get it out of his mouth and it’s there. And that’s the way God is with us. When we’re obedient, he gives us all these good things. But we have to make sure that our commitments are right before we expect God to do great things for us. Seek to know his will. Seek, seek, seek to know his will, by his word, before you ask. Seek to know his will, by this Word, or a word that he speaks to you, before you ask for anything. Don’t run; don’t ask so quick. Please. That is some of the reasons why we do not get our prayers answered. And if we will seek to know his will by his word, before you ask, he cannot fail. He says. “I will not fail.” He cannot fail. You’ll get your prayers answered just like that, if it’s asked in his will. If you seek and ask him, before you ask him what it is, seek him; ask him if it’s his will that you do this or that you do that. Then ask him to do it and he’ll do it.
                    Then he said, “Wait.” And I said, “Yes,” and I waited. Finally he said, “Wait.” So I wrote that again. Finally he said, “Wait,” three times, “In peace.” See, there’s a waiting, then there’s a waiting in peace. You wait in peace, knowing that if he hears you, he will answer.</p>
